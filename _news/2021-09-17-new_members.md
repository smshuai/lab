We just had two new Master's students, Wei Tao (é™¶çŽ®) and Nuo Xu (è®¸è¯º) joined the COmics universe!
They both did their undergraduate studies at Wuhan and now they are both interested in analyzing omics data.

We wish they can enjoy their COmics life and make scientific discovery simultaneouslyðŸ˜„

You can learn more about them [here](/team/) and please say hi when you meet them at SUSTech.

PS, we also had our first group dinner yesterday to welcome new members and celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival together with a future visiting student (Xintong).
Cantonese cuisine is sooooo good!
